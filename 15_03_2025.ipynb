            "1.  **WIDAL Test:**\n",

            "    *   This test checks for antibodies against *Salmonella Typhi* and *Paratyphi* bacteria, which cause typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever.\n",
            "    *   The results are given as dilutions (e.g., 1:160).  A higher number after the \"1:\" suggests more antibodies are present.\n",
            "    *   *S. Typhi \"O\"* (1:160) and *S. Typhi \"H\"* (1:80) are both elevated above the normal range of 1:20, which *could* indicate a current or recent typhoid infection, but further investigation is needed.  *S. Paratyphi AH* and *BH* are normal at 1:20.\n",
            "    *   **In simple terms:** This test might indicate that Mr. Goud has or recently had typhoid fever, though other tests are needed to confirm this.\n",

            "    *   This test checks for Dengue fever.\n",
            "    *   **NS1 Antigen:** Detects the Dengue virus early in the infection.\n",
            "    *   **IgG and IgM:** These are antibodies that the body produces to fight the Dengue virus.  IgM appears early in the infection, and IgG appears later and can indicate a past infection.\n",
            "    *   **Results:** All three (NS1, IgG, and IgM) are NEGATIVE.\n",
            "    *   **In simple terms:**  Mr. Goud does not currently have, and likely has not recently had, Dengue fever based on this test.\n",

            "    *   This test measures how quickly red blood cells settle to the bottom of a test tube.  A faster rate can indicate inflammation in the body.\n",
            "    *   **Results:** ESR 1st Hour is 26 mm/hr and ESR 2nd Hour is 52 mm/hr. The normal range is 0-8 mm/hr. Both results are elevated.\n",
            "    *   **In simple terms:** This suggests there is inflammation in Mr. Goud's body.  It doesn't pinpoint the cause, but indicates something is causing inflammation.\n",

            "4.  **RAPID MALARIA TEST:**\n",
